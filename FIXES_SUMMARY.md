## 🔍 ANALYSIS SUMMARY

### Issues Identified & Fixed:

#### ✅ **Issue #1: Missing `last_login` Column (CRITICAL)**

- **Location**: `app.py` line ~947
- **Impact**: Database error on every login attempt
- **Fix Applied**: Commented out the `last_login` UPDATE statement

#### ✅ **Issue #2: Lack of Request Logging**
- **Problem**: No visibility into whether HTTP requests were reaching Flask
- **Impact**: Made debugging impossible
