# Quiz Question Display Issue - FIXED ✅

## Issue Found:
The quiz questions were not displaying because of a **template variable mismatch**.

### Root Cause:
- **In `app.py` (line 2073)**: Questions are stored in session with key `'question'`
  ```python
  question_data = {
      'question': question_text,  # ← Stores as 'question'
      ...
  }
  ```

- **In `templates/quiz/question.html` (line 18)**: Template was looking for `question_text`
  ```django-html
  {{ question.question_text }}  # ← Looking for 'question_text' (WRONG)
  ```

### Fix Applied:
Changed the template to handle both variable names:
```django-html
{{ question.question or question.question_text }}  # ← Now works with both!
```

## Additional Issues Found (Non-Critical):

1. ⚠️ **Missing `completed_at` column** in `quiz_sessions` table
   - Error: `column "completed_at" does not exist`
   - Impact: Dashboard stats may not work properly
   - Fix needed: Add column or update queries

2. ⚠️ **Missing `user_activities` table**
   - Error: `relation "user_activities" does not exist`
   - Impact: Activity logging fails (but login still works)
   - Fix needed: Create table or disable activity logging

These don't prevent login or quiz functionality but should be addressed for full functionality.
