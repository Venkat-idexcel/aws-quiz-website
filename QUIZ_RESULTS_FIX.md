# Quiz Results Storage - FIXED

## Issues Found and Fixed

### ✅ Issue 1: Results Not Being Saved to Database
**Problem:** `question_id` field was missing from session data, causing KeyError when trying to save answers.

**Fix:** Added `'question_id': str(q['question_id'])` to the question_data dictionary in app.py line ~2072

**File:** `app.py` - `take_quiz()` function
```python
question_data = {
    'id': int(q['id']),
    'question_id': str(q['question_id']),  # ✅ ADDED THIS LINE
    'question': question_text,
    ...
}
```

### ✅ Issue 2: Correct Answer Count Not Displaying
**Problem:** Template variable mismatch - template used `{{ correct_count }}` but view passed `correct_answers`

**Fix:** Changed template variable from `correct_count` to `correct_answers`

**File:** `templates/quiz/results.html` line ~56
```html
<span class="stat-number">{{ correct_answers }}</span>  <!-- ✅ CHANGED FROM correct_count -->
```

## Verification

Run this script to verify results are being saved:
```bash
python check_results_saved.py
```

Expected output should show:
- ✅ Quiz sessions with `is_completed = TRUE`
- ✅ Correct number of `correct_answers` populated
- ✅ `score_percentage` calculated
- ✅ User answers recorded in `user_answers` table

## Test Steps

1. **Start a new quiz** at http://localhost:5000/quiz
2. **Answer all questions** 
3. **Submit the quiz**
4. **Check results page** - should now display:
   - ✅ Correct number of correct answers
   - ✅ Total questions
   - ✅ Score percentage
   - ✅ Time taken
5. **Verify database** - run `python check_results_saved.py`
