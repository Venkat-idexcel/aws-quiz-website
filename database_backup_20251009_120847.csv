2019,A company wants to integrate their on-premises data warehouse with Amazon Redshift for hybrid analytics. They need to query data from both systems as if it were in a single location. Which AWS service should they use?,AWS Glue,AWS Data Pipeline,Amazon Redshift Spectrum,AWS Database Migration Service (DMS),,C,"Amazon Redshift Spectrum allows you to query data stored in Amazon S3 using Amazon Redshift. By loading data from the on-premises data warehouse into S3, you can then query both the data in Redshift and the data in S3 (originally from on-premises) as if it were in a single location. AWS Glue is for ETL operations, not for querying. AWS Data Pipeline is for moving data, not for querying. AWS DMS is for migrating data, not for querying.",AWS Data Engineer,,2025-10-07 03:56:33.339941
2020,A data engineer needs to create a data pipeline that processes streaming data from Amazon Kinesis and loads it into Amazon S3. They want to use a serverless solution. Which AWS service should they use?,AWS Glue,AWS Data Pipeline,AWS Lambda,Amazon EMR,,A,AWS Glue can process streaming data from Amazon Kinesis and load it into Amazon S3 using its streaming ETL capabilities. It's a serverless solution that can handle continuous data processing without managing infrastructure. AWS Data Pipeline is not designed for streaming data. AWS Lambda could be used but would require more custom code to handle the streaming to S3 process. Amazon EMR requires managing clusters.,AWS Data Engineer,,2025-10-07 03:56:33.339941
2021,A company wants to integrate their Salesforce data with their Amazon Redshift data warehouse for unified analytics. They want to use a fully managed service. Which AWS service should they use?,AWS Glue,AWS Data Pipeline,Amazon AppFlow,AWS Database Migration Service (DMS),,C,"Amazon AppFlow is a fully managed service that can transfer data between SaaS applications like Salesforce and AWS services like Amazon Redshift. It's specifically designed for SaaS integrations and requires minimal configuration. AWS Glue could be used but requires more setup for Salesforce integration. AWS Data Pipeline could work but is less specialized for SaaS integrations. AWS DMS is for databases, not SaaS applications. ## Domain 7: Data Optimization and Performance (5%)",AWS Data Engineer,,2025-10-07 03:56:33.339941
2022,A data engineer needs to optimize the performance of queries run against a large dataset stored in Amazon S3. The queries are complex and involve multiple joins and aggregations. Which technique should they use to improve query performance?,Increase the size of the Amazon Athena compute resources,Partition the data in Amazon S3,Convert the data to a row-based format like CSV,Store the data in Amazon DynamoDB instead,,B,"Partitioning the data in Amazon S3 is the most effective technique for improving query performance for complex queries involving multiple joins and aggregations. Partitioning organizes data into directories based on column values (like date, region, etc.), which allows query engines like Amazon Athena to skip reading irrelevant data, significantly improving performance. While increasing Athena compute resources can help, it's more costly and less efficient than proper partitioning. Converting to a row-based format like CSV would actually decrease performance compared to columnar formats like Parquet or ORC. Storing the data in DynamoDB would not be suitable for complex analytical queries.",AWS Data Engineer,,2025-10-07 03:56:33.339941
2023,A company wants to optimize the storage costs of their data lake in Amazon S3 while maintaining good query performance for frequently accessed data. Which S3 storage class should they use for this data?,S3 Standard,S3 Standard-IA (Infrequent Access),S3 One Zone-IA,S3 Intelligent-Tiering,,D,"S3 Intelligent-Tiering is the most appropriate storage class for optimizing storage costs while maintaining good query performance for frequently accessed data. It automatically moves data between frequent access and infrequent access tiers based on changing access patterns, ensuring cost optimization without performance impact. S3 Standard is designed for frequent access but doesn't optimize costs for data that becomes less frequently accessed. S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA have lower retrieval costs but higher latency, making them less suitable for frequently accessed data.",AWS Data Engineer,,2025-10-07 03:56:33.339941
2024,A data engineer needs to optimize the performance of their Amazon Redshift cluster. They notice that some queries are taking a long time to execute. Which technique should they use to improve query performance?,Increase the number of nodes in the cluster,Redistribute data to improve distribution,Convert data to columnar format,All of the above,,D,"All the listed techniques can improve query performance in Amazon Redshift. Increasing the number of nodes provides more computational power. Redistributing data ensures even distribution across nodes, preventing data skew. Converting data to columnar format (which Redshift already uses) is fundamental to its performance, but ensuring optimal column encoding can further improve performance. A comprehensive approach to performance optimization in Redshift typically involves multiple techniques.",AWS Data Engineer,,2025-10-07 03:56:33.339941
2025,A company wants to optimize the performance of their AWS Glue ETL jobs. They notice that the jobs are taking a long time to complete. Which technique should they use to improve job performance?,Increase the number of workers in the Glue job,Use Glue's dynamic frame pushdown,Partition the input data,All of the above,,D,"All the listed techniques can improve the performance of AWS Glue ETL jobs. Increasing the number of workers provides more computational power. Using Glue's dynamic frame pushdown pushes filtering operations down to the data source, reducing the amount of data processed. Partitioning the input data allows Glue to process only relevant partitions, reducing I/O. A comprehensive approach to performance optimization in Glue typically involves multiple techniques.",AWS Data Engineer,,2025-10-07 03:56:33.339941
2026,A data engineer needs to optimize the performance of queries run against a large dataset stored in Amazon S3 using Amazon Athena. Which technique should they use to improve query performance?,Increase the size of the Athena compute resources,Convert the data to a columnar format like Parquet,Compress the data using a compression algorithm like Snappy,All of the above,,D,"All the listed techniques can improve query performance in Amazon Athena. Increasing the size of the Athena compute resources provides more computational power. Converting data to a columnar format like Parquet allows Athena to read only the columns needed for the query, reducing I/O. Compressing the data reduces the amount of data that needs to be read from S3. A comprehensive approach to performance optimization in Athena typically involves multiple techniques. ## Domain 8: Data Monitoring and Troubleshooting (5%)",AWS Data Engineer,,2025-10-07 03:56:33.339941
2027,A data engineer needs to monitor the performance of their AWS Glue ETL jobs. They want to set up alerts when jobs fail or run longer than expected. Which AWS service should they use?,Amazon CloudWatch,AWS CloudTrail,AWS Config,AWS X-Ray,,A,"Amazon CloudWatch is the most appropriate service for monitoring the performance of AWS Glue ETL jobs and setting up alerts. CloudWatch collects metrics and logs from AWS services, including Glue, and allows you to create alarms that notify you when specific thresholds are breached, such as job failures or long run times.
